## Getting Started

The app is 100% Swift. User interface is built mostly in code using [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) DSL. The current architecture is MVVM-C, but moving forward we are open to consider some Redux-like state management implementation.

## Setup

We are using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to manage dependencies.
Clone the repo and then run:

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
$ pod install
```

CocoaPods requires that you open the *SEDaily-IOS.xcworkspace*.

```
$ open SEDaily-IOS.xcworkspace
```

## Dependencies

There are +25 various dependencies used in the project. Moving forward some of them may be subject to change/removal. 
The most important ones are:

* [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) - Build layouts in code.
* [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - Industry standard for networking.
* [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) - Caching images.
* [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) - Swift language linter.
